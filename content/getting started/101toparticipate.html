<h3>
	101 Ways to Participate...and make the future Java
</h3>
<p>In case you missed it earlier today, and as promised in BOF6283, here are the 101 Ways to Improve (and Make the Future) Java...
thanks to RajMahendra Hegde, Mani Manasa Mylavarapu, Anakar Parida and Jyothiprasad Buddha of the Hyderabad Java Community for their contributions!
You can always come up with new ideas and the features to develop. You can also contribute by giving sessions and by starting a new project. People
can join you and contrbute to your project. The art of learning and participating has taken into new level. There are 101 ways how you can participate
and contribute to Java. Below are few lists of ways how you can successfully contribute to the group. Your participation and zeal to do something
will take you to a new level where you dreamt of being there. The successful participation depends on individual contribution. You can always ask
questions and how to contribute to the Java community. There are several other languages apart from Java that the community helps to learn and to understand.</p>
